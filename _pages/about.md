Kaidong Zhang is a final year Ph.D candidate at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). He is under the supervision of [Dong Liu](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~dongeliu/), and work closely with [Jingjing Fu](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jifu/) at MSRA. He also maintains a good cooperative relationship with the department of orthopedics, the first affiliated hospital of the university of science and technology of China.

His research interests include low-level vision, medical image processing and NeRF-based 3D rendering. He concentrated on video super-resolution and enhancement in the early period, and won the [2nd place in AI+4K HDR track of the first National Artificial Intelligence Competition (NAIC)](https://sist.ustc.edu.cn/2020/0304/c5146a413984/page.htm). Later, he transferred his research interest to video inpainting and editing, and published several papers on top conferences in computer vision. His paper [FGT](https://github.com/hitachinsk/FGT) receives considerable attention from research community, and is reported by several computer vision forums, including VALSE and AI Time. Now, he focuses more on the modeling of 3D reality in computer vision and the medical image processing for ground-breaking applications. 

Kaidong Zhang received the B.Sc degree from Xi\'an Jiaotong University in 2019. Here is the [curriculum vitae](https://hitachinsk.github.io/files/kd_cv.pdf).
