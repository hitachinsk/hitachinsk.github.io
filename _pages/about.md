His research interests include low-level vision, medical image processing and NeRF-based 3D rendering. He concentrated on video super-resolution and enhancement in the early period, and won the [2nd place in AI+4K HDR track of the first National Artificial Intelligence Competition (NAIC)](https://sist.ustc.edu.cn/2020/0304/c5146a413984/page.htm). Later, he transferred his research interest to video inpainting and editing, and published several papers on top conferences in computer vision. Now, he focuses more on the modeling of 3D reality in computer vision and the medical image processing for ground-breaking applications. 

Kaidong Zhang received the B.Sc degree from Xi\'an Jiaotong University in 2019. Here is the [curriculum vitae](https://hitachinsk.github.io/files/kd_cv.pdf).
