excerpt: 'We first integrate the philosophy of flow-guided method to transformer for video inpainting with reasonable structure and detailed texture simultaneously. We exploit the local correlation of motion fields and adopt the motion discrepancy in the completed flows to guide the transformer-based content synthesis. We also design elaborated window-partition and spatial-temporal decoupled transformer strategy for the balance between efficiency and performance.'
