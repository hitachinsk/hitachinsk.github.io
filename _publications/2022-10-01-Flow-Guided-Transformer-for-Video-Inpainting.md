excerpt: 'We first integrate the philosophy of flow-guided method to transformer for video inpainting with **reasonable structure** and **detailed texture** simultaneously. We exploit the local correlation of motion fields for more accurate flow completion, and adopt the motion discrepancy between foreground and background in the completed flows to guide the transformer-based content synthesis. What's more, we design elaborated window-partition and spatial-temporal decoupled transformer strategy for the balance between efficiency and performance.'
