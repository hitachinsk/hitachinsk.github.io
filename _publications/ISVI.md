title: "Inertia-Guided Flow Completion and Style Fusion for Video Inpainting"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/ISVI
excerpt: 'We show the benefit of explicit inertia prior for flow completion, which leads to more accurate flow-guided content propagation for video inpainting. We also first discuss the style incoherence caused by flow warping across different frames and propose the style fusion mechanism to refine the style in the warped regions under the guidance of the styles from valid regions.'
